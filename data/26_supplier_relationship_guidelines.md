# Document 26: Supplier Relationship Guidelines

**Metadata**: Guidelines-SUPPLIER-001, Procurement Department, July 2023

## Selection and Onboarding

Supplier partnerships require completion of formal evaluation processes including request for proposal procedures and comprehensive assessment. Evaluation criteria encompass pricing, service quality, dependability, and alignment with organizational standards. Agreements exceeding $25,000 require legal department review and senior management authorization.

## Ongoing Performance Assessment

Supplier effectiveness receives quarterly evaluation against predetermined service level agreements and performance indicators. Scheduled business reviews maintain contractor compliance with agreement terms and identify enhancement opportunities. Suppliers failing to meet standards receive formal improvement notices and corrective action plans.

## Agreement Administration

Supplier agreements incorporate standard provisions for information security, confidentiality protection, and regulatory compliance. Contract renewal processes include performance evaluation and competitive market analysis to maintain favorable terms. Standard payment terms follow Net-30 protocols unless alternative arrangements receive prior approval.
