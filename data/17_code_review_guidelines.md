# Document 17: Code Review Guidelines

**Metadata**: Guidelines-ENG-002, Engineering Department, May 2023

## Review Process

All code changes must undergo peer review before merging to main branches. Reviewers should examine code for functionality, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards. Reviews must be completed within 24 hours during business days to maintain development velocity.

## Quality Standards

Code submissions should include appropriate unit tests with minimum 80% coverage. Documentation must be updated to reflect any API changes or new functionality. All code must pass automated linting and security scanning before review submission.

## Feedback Guidelines

Review comments should be constructive and specific, focusing on code quality rather than personal preferences. Reviewers should explain reasoning behind suggestions and provide examples when helpful. Discussions should remain professional and focused on improving code quality.
