# Document 30: Client Service Standards

**Metadata**: Standards-SERVICE-001, Customer Success Department, September 2023

## Issue Tracking and Response

Customer service requests must be recorded in the support management system within 30 minutes of initial contact. Response priorities are categorized by urgency levels: critical (1-hour response), high priority (4-hour response), standard (8-hour response), and routine (24-hour response). Service representatives should maintain regular communication with clients regarding resolution progress.

## Problem Resolution Escalation

Technical challenges requiring specialized expertise should be transferred to senior support personnel or development teams when standard resolution timeframes are exceeded. Service quality concerns must be immediately escalated to department management for review. Escalation documentation should include comprehensive records of troubleshooting activities performed.

## Service Excellence Metrics

Client interactions must uphold professional communication standards while demonstrating understanding and concern for customer needs. Target first-call resolution rate is established at 80% for all service requests. Post-resolution satisfaction surveys measure service effectiveness and identify opportunities for process enhancement.
