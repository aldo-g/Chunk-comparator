# Document 18: Software Development Standards

**Metadata**: Standards-DEV-001, Engineering Department, July 2023

## Code Quality Requirements

All software submissions require peer review prior to integration with primary development branches. Code reviewers must assess functionality, security compliance, and conformance to established coding conventions. Review completion is expected within one business day to support continuous development practices.

## Testing and Documentation

Software contributions must include comprehensive unit testing achieving a minimum of 80% code coverage. Technical documentation should be updated concurrently with code changes, particularly for API modifications or feature additions. All submissions must successfully complete automated quality checks and security validations.

## Collaboration Standards

Code review feedback should be detailed and constructive, emphasizing technical improvements over stylistic preferences. Reviewers should provide clear explanations for suggested changes and include relevant examples. All technical discussions must maintain professional standards and focus on enhancing software quality.
