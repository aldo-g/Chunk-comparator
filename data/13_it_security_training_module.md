## Password Security

All employees must use strong passwords containing at least 12 characters with a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords must be unique for each system and changed every 90 days. The use of password managers is strongly encouraged to maintain password complexity and uniqueness.

## Phishing Awareness

Employees should be vigilant about suspicious emails requesting personal information or urgent action. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown senders. When in doubt, verify the senderâ€™s identity through a separate communication channel before taking any action.

## Data Handling

Confidential company data must be classified and handled according to our data classification policy. Sensitive information should never be shared via unsecured channels such as personal email or messaging apps. All data transmissions must use encrypted channels and approved company systems.
