**Metadata**: Framework-REVIEW-001, HR Department, January 2024

## Assessment Timeline

Comprehensive performance evaluations occur annually in March for all team members. Quarterly check-ins replace the previous mid-year reviews to provide more frequent feedback and support. Supervisors must schedule evaluation meetings with at least two weeksâ€™ notice and distribute self-assessment materials.

## Performance Metrics

Evaluations assess goal attainment, core competencies, and professional growth initiatives. The rating system uses a four-point scale ranging from developing to exceptional performance. All ratings require specific behavioral examples and continuous documentation throughout the review period.

## Growth and Advancement

Performance discussions include collaborative development of individual growth plans with clear, measurable objectives for the upcoming year. Career progression conversations address skill requirements for advancement and identify relevant professional development opportunities. Compensation reviews consider performance outcomes alongside current market benchmarks.
