**Metadata**: Policy-VENDOR-001, Procurement Department, March 2023

## Vendor Selection

All vendor relationships must go through a formal selection process including RFP development and evaluation. Vendors are assessed on cost, quality, reliability, and compliance with company standards. Contracts require legal review and executive approval for agreements over $25,000.

## Performance Monitoring

Vendor performance is evaluated quarterly against established service level agreements and quality metrics. Regular business reviews ensure vendors meet contractual obligations and identify improvement opportunities. Underperforming vendors receive formal notification and improvement plans.

## Contract Management

All vendor contracts include standard terms for data protection, confidentiality, and compliance requirements. Contract renewals require performance review and market analysis to ensure competitive pricing. Payment terms are standardized at Net-30 unless special arrangements are pre-approved.
