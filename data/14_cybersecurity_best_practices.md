## Account Security

All user accounts must implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to company systems. Passwords should contain at least 12 characters with complexity requirements including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Regular password updates every 90 days are mandatory for all employees.

## Email Security Protocols

Employees must exercise caution when handling email communications, particularly those requesting sensitive information or immediate action. Suspicious emails should be reported to the IT security team immediately. Links and attachments from external sources require verification before opening.

## Information Protection

Company data must be classified according to sensitivity levels and handled with appropriate security measures. Confidential information transmission must occur through encrypted, company-approved channels only. Personal devices and unsecured communication platforms are prohibited for business data.
