# Document 29: Customer Support Procedures

**Metadata**: Procedures-SUPPORT-001, Customer Success Department, May 2023

## Ticket Management

All customer inquiries must be logged in the support ticket system within 30 minutes of receipt. Tickets are prioritized based on severity levels: critical (1 hour response), high (4 hours), medium (8 hours), and low (24 hours). Support agents should provide regular updates to customers on ticket progress.

## Escalation Process

Complex technical issues should be escalated to senior support staff or engineering teams when resolution time exceeds SLA requirements. Customer complaints about service quality must be escalated to support managers immediately. Escalation procedures include detailed documentation of previous troubleshooting steps.

## Quality Standards

Support interactions should maintain professional communication standards and demonstrate empathy for customer concerns. First contact resolution is the goal for 80% of support tickets. Customer satisfaction surveys are sent after ticket closure to measure service quality and identify improvement areas.
